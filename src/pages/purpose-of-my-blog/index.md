##What is the blog about?

It is a place where I would write down my understanding of a concept about software development.

##How would it be organized?

Each blog will be constructed as what, how, and why. I will write about what the concept is, how it is used, and why it exists.

##Why do I create this blog?

As a full stack developer, I love open source libraries, platforms, and services written by others. It is great to use others' code so that I don't need to start from scratch everytime.

The modern web development is filled with awesome shiny tools and libraries that made life a lot easier and better, but sometimes it can be overwhelming to learn many different things.

All those tools and libraries are built with concepts other people create. It is very important to understand how the tool is created and what issue it addresses because once people understand it they could use it more efficient and even improve it a little bit. If the tool is improved more people would likely to use it, and new people improve it and so on.

Blogging is an efficient way to share ideas with other people. I hope that my blog can help others to understand concepts of the software development.

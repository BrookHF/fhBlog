# Software Framework

## what is software framework?

A software framework is a software build by some experienced software developer to make people who use the framework build good software easier.

## How is software framework used?

Developers generally pick a good framework of their choice, or someone in his or her company chose it for him or her.
A software framework like spring, node, or Django does commonly use infrastructure items such as data-persistence, authentication, routing, and template rending for a developer.

## Why is software framework used?

Developers use software framework to build software faster, batter and more reliable.
For example, if you need to cut a piece of paper to 10 cm by 10 cm, then you would likely just cut it with scissors and ruler. But, suppose you are running a shop selling this paper 1000 piece a day. Then, you would not measure it 1000 times; Instead, you would make a frame of 10 cm by 10 cm, and it would help you to cut paper much faster.
The experienced developer does build software every day. Some of them developed software framework to make other developer's life easier, same as making the paper frame.
